      <h1>About COVID</h1>
      <p>
        Coronavirus is infectious. 
That is, it can make people sick by transferring from one person's 
body to another's body when they touch or spend time together. 
Coronavirus can spread from one person to another before you become ill.
A fever, a dry cough, and some difficulty breathing are 
common symptoms of coronavirus infection.
Coronavirus can affect anyone. It can be quite problematic 
for the elderly or those suffering from severe medical conditions.

Until scientists figure out how to eliminate the coronavirus, 
you and your family may have to make, more significant changes.
You might need to avoid congested areas. 
This is because crowds make it easier for coronavirus to spread and infect more people.
For the same reason, your parents may not work as much or may try to work from home. 
You might not be able to go to school or hangout with friends.
When you go outside, you may notice people wearing masks.   
        

Stay at home unless you require medical attention.
Keep an eye on your symptoms. 
If your symptoms worsen, contact your healthcare practitioner right at once.
DO NOT WAIT.Rest and drink plenty of water. 
To feel better, take over-the-counter medications 
If you have a medical appointment, advise your doctor 
ahead of time that you have COVID-19 or may have it.
Keep to one room and away from other people in your house. 
Wear a mask if you must be among others.
